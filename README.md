Working on this project provided valuable insights into both practical AI development and broader computer science principles. The project focused on implementing a deep Q-learning solution for a Treasure Hunt game, where an AI pirate needed to navigate efficiently to find treasure while avoiding obstacles. The provided codebase included the basic game infrastructure through TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py files, along with maze environment setup, visualization tools, and the Neural Network model architecture. My main contribution was implementing the Q-learning training algorithm, which required carefully balancing exploration versus exploitation, managing the training loop, and tuning various hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. This project exemplifies what computer scientists do at a fundamental level - solving complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components and developing algorithmic solutions. The challenge of pathfinding was decomposed into clear elements: state representation through the maze environment, action selection for movement choices, reward design for feedback, and the learning algorithm itself. This systematic approach demonstrates how computer scientists make seemingly intractable problems solvable through careful abstraction and incremental problem-solving steps.The work also highlighted key problem-solving principles in computer science. These included problem decomposition, iterative improvement through training, empirical validation of solutions, and optimization of parameters. These approaches aren't unique to AI development but represent core strategies used throughout computer science to tackle complex challenges.As a computer scientist, this project emphasized crucial ethical responsibilities to both end users and organizations. Safety considerations were paramount - ensuring the AI agent could reliably find safe paths is critical for real-world applications. Transparency in the learning process, efficient use of computational resources, and robust handling of edge cases were all essential considerations. The need for thorough testing reinforced the importance of reliability in AI systems. These aspects demonstrate how computer scientists must balance technical excellence with ethical considerations, ensuring their solutions are not only effective but also responsible and trustworthy.
